## Our Team

Our project is a database of dinosaurs which we named Dinosaur Search (styled dinosaur search). This project is comprised of three features: a Dinosaur Profiles section with a card for each dinosaur along with the ability to search by name, a Dinosaur Map section which is interactive and allows the user to see where dinosaurs originated from by both continent and individual country, and a Dinosaur Diets section which breaks down the diets of dinosaurs by several eras. 

This site is also mobile optimized. For our mobile version, many of the interactive features have either been removed or adapted for a better experience on a smaller screen.
